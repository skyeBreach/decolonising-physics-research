**Chat Notes**
- we didnt cover this in our group, so I dont want to taint everyone there! This is my personal view- but just to say, in a lot of antiracism work (and gender equality too), it is clear that continuing to do data collection about whether a course/ institute is racist etc is insulting. - we should be at a point where we fully accept these issues exist, and act to correct them.
	- Whilst i whole heartedly agree with this unfortunatly there will be physicists who do not understand or know that this is going on, and as someone else said "physicists love data." so this could be a way to get them to understand it.

**Written Notes**
1.  "To effectivly decolonise requires a praxis of undoing and redoing" - Walsh and Mignolo
2. Diversification and Decolonisation are different but necassarily linked via intersectionality
	1. Look at definitions for both of these
	2. In general diversity should come from decolonisation
	3. EDI should be built off of decol work as the majority of the minority groups in england (disabled, ethnic, LGBTQIA+, etc) are discriminated against largly due to previous colonisation efforts and as such decolonisation aids the efforts of all these groups. Whilst this is being said some groups are more oppressed than others due to this areas IE ethnic miniorities. 
3. All decolonisation efforts need to be done in such a way that they do not become a minority tax
4. In general the IOP is doing some good stuff on Decolonisation (going to add looking at this to my todo list)
5. One way to add in some of this decol to the curriculum is to get students to do research projects of physicists from there own background, someone like them (IE similiar in ethnicity, culture, sexuality, gender, etc) this is a good way to show them that they can be scientists
	1. This should not be done just on its own its not enought but it is a good example of a way of decolonising a physics module.
	2. Especially good to be done in first year
	3. Example is of number systems, my partner was from india and we looked at Srinivasa Ramanujan.
6. There needs to be an extension of the existing networks for academics along with an increasing of aid resources
	1. Physicsts are not social scientists and would most likely find it difficult to persue this stuff
7. In general no one knows what a decolonised world or science would look like as it has never existed, and the decolonisation work should never stop.
8. This needs to be seen as an area of academic research for physicists otherwise they may never fully 

**Ideas for project direction from this seminar**
- Definition of what decolonsation means for physics
	- How we go about this an honest and safe way but still effective
		- Honest and safe really us not good terminology but idk what is
- Looking at the current baises within physics departments IE living situation for students (money) during covid and how lower class or/and ethnic minority familiys were much more effected than others ( check to make sure this is a thing )
- Methods of decolonising within physics specifically
	- Resources that can be used
	- ways we can bring others on 
	- etc
- Look into role models. These dont need to be long dead/old people 
	- Current researchers
	- student role models
	- science content creators
- How EDI Work can be built of the efforts of the decolonisation work
