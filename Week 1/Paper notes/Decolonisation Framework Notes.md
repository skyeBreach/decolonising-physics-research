- Students from minoritised groups have highlighted sense of alienation partially caused by curriculum content. 
- Framework also feeds into a the unversity-wide sense of belonging work.
- Quotes from students (Module reviews and conversations) i found useful:
	- I want modules that dont have questions of race, disaillty or gender a an after-thought or a special week"
	- Seeing myself as an active part of my research as is practicised in decoloniality, rather than a passive commentator/analysist has made me much more engaged with my work and motivated me too"
- \*\* "Decolonisation cannot be applied singularly to the currciulmum or to the attainment gab. it feeds into, amongst other things, the very structure of the university, the experience of the students staff and wider publics, knowledge creation and outputs, and stymied institutional cultures and mind sets" (Dr Rima Saini, LSE)
	- IE the effort needs not just be there for the teaching but how the department opperates want modules that dont have questions of race, disaillty or gender a an after-thought or a special week"
- All academics must share the responsibillity equally to ensure that this responsibillity is not just put on staff/students who are from these minoritised students that already suffer from institutionalised racism and discrimination.

**Definiton of decolonial eduction**
- To question the origins of the knowledge taught and the colonial legacies replicated within
- To challenge the presence of a hidden curriculm of assumed knowlede that unfairly disadvantages many
- to ask whose knowledges ad voices are undervalued and silenced
- to work proactivly to rebalance such unequal power dynamics
- It is one where the evaluaton of the curriculum and pedagogical practices is an evolving and responsive process and has partnership between the staff and student body at its heart
- it aims to cbat racial prejudices and discrimination and to challenge racialised privilege
- it is relevant and applicable to all disciplines across the university
- as well as addressing questions of curriculum and pedagogy, it also encompasses wider university structures and practices

**Notes on the implementational approach to the above**
- (1.2) Decolonising work should be carried out in conjunction with students so that they have a sustained and meaningful input into curricula and pedagogy. **However, students should not be wholy responsible**
- (1.5) Decolonial pedagogy will be recognised and highlighted through the creation of a Leeds' decolonising mark. this will be institutional level recognition of modules that offer a diversse and inclusive range of topics, case studies, and reading list items to their students and/or taught and assessed decolonial pedagogy. The award will be visible in minerva  and on the module cataogue to help inform student choice.
	- Origionally noted due to it seeming abit weird but after writing this it makes sense!
- (1.8) Positive action policies should be applied to student opportunity programmes and progression to certain accademic programmes based on an academic potential to achieve model
	- This seems abit jank to me but without looing into the "academic potential to achieve model" idk what this would look like.
- (2.1) A cross-instituion decolonising student advisory board will be formed (working with LUU) to be composed of:
	- 2 representatives from each faculty
	- 3 from the doctoral college
	Each represntivie will be paid for their work, which will include making recommendations on decolonising policies and organising and promoting student-led decolonising events
- (3.2) A revew of student support mechanisms and procedures (Including (academic personal tutoring) to reflect upon situations that disproportionalty impact minoritised students)
