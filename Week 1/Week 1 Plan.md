- [ ] Get an overarching plan for the entire project that is fluid enought to allow for tangents etc
- [x] Read and annotate supplied material then put into this vault key points 
	- [x] Decolonising Framework
	- [x] UG chemistry resource
	- [x] The paper released by the york team (if it is not the same as the above)
- [x] Send of emails to get the extra resources from the FEPS seminar (doesnt look to be out yet)
	- [ ] Not out at this time
- [ ] Come up with an overaching definition for what decolonising physics means
- [ ] Look into how chemistry and biology have decolonised there curriculum 
- [ ] Get a list of questions to look into within this topic and start to narrow down what this project means for me
- [ ] Try get preliminary data of admissions to the physics department based off:
	- Ethnicity
	- Sexuality
	- Gender identity (Specifically from non cisgender)
	- disabillity (probably not going to happen due to ethics)
- [x] Organise this vault to make sense to future me (probably difficult due to skitty brain) [THIS AINT HAPPENING]
- [ ] Find the damn resource the york printed paper is talking about 
- [ ] Decide on a preliminary set of questons to ask on the questionaire and give reasoning
- [x] Use web of science to look up both the words "physics" and "decolonising" to see if there are any results other than that 1 really angry letter like paper
- [ ] Look at the imperial stuff on 'geographic bias'
	- I personally dont like this word as it loses some of the point of decolonisation
- [ ] Look at the definitons for diversification and decolonsation
	- These need to be distinct definitions as these are different (but linked) topics 
- [ ] Look at how to present decolonisation to academics to not make them rage
