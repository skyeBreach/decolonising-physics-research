**Number of papers written on this**
	- After looking up on WOS the terms "physics" and "decol" only 4 results were found, with one of these results being what i can only describe as an extremly angry letter, another one being a conversation about decolonization of thought as such is not of relevance when looking at the specific lense of physics, and 2 being from previously colonized countries (Brazil and Zimbabwe). 
	  All results found were from between 2016-2021(early access paper).
	  This shows that either the ideas of decolonising physics:
		- Are not being talked about on a research level
		- There is some bias when publishing these papers, where they are not being published by the global norths publishing journals
		- WOS currently does not have any records of these papers
	  Whilst there are really the 3 options above for why there was only 2-3 "appraochable"(find a better word) papers they all lead to the same conclusion:
	  That the ideas of decolonisation in physics needs to be a more wide spread topic and talked about more within academic circles contained within the global north especially at the research level. Along with this it shows how recent these ideas have entered physics circles.
	- Looking up the similiar terms in google scholar gives another 4 results two of which are the same (angry letter and the Zimbabwe paper) the other 2 were from the global north with 1 not looking like a strictly decolonizing physics paper ( canada and the US )
