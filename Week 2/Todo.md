- [ ] Come up with an overaching definition for what decolonising physics means
- [ ] Look at the definitons for diversification and decolonsation
	- These need to be distinct definitions as these are different (but linked) topics 
- [ ] Look at how to present decolonisation to academics to not make them rage
- [ ] Get a list of questions to look into within this topic and start to narrow down what this project means for me
- [ ] Try get preliminary data of admissions to the physics department based off:
	- Ethnicity
	- Sexuality
	- Gender identity (Specifically from non cisgender)
	- disabillity (probably not going to happen due to ethics)
- [ ] Decide on a preliminary set of questons to ask on the questionaire and give reasoning
	- [ ] Academics and staff
	- [ ] Students
