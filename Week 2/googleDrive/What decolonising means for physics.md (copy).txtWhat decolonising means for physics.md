**Definitions for Decolonising**
 - Decolonising education involves **examining the limitations and biases of the current curriculum; the omissions in initial teacher education and training; and examining the political and societal legacies of colonialism and how they have influenced education policies**

**Number of papers written on this**
	- After looking up on WOS the terms "physics" and "decol" only 4 results were found, with one of these results being what i can only describe as an extremely angry letter, another one being a conversation about decolonization of thought as such is not of relevance when looking at the specific lense of physics, and 2 being from previously colonized countries (Brazil and Zimbabwe). 
	  All results found were from between 2016-2021(early access paper).
	  This shows that either the ideas of decolonising physics:
		- Are not being talked about on a research level
		- There is some bias when publishing these papers, where they are not being published by the global norths publishing journals
		- WOS currently does not have any records of these papers
	  Whilst there are really the 3 options above for why there was only 2-3 "appraochable"(find a better word) papers they all lead to the same conclusion:
	  That the ideas of decolonisation in physics needs to be a more wide spread topic and talked about more within academic circles contained within the global north especially at the research level. Along with this it shows how recent these ideas have entered physics circles.
	- Looking up the similar terms in google scholar gives another 4 results two of which are the same (angry letter and the Zimbabwe paper) the other 2 were from the global north with 1 not looking like a strictly decolonizing physics paper ( canada and the US )

**Decolonisation of Physics"Hard" definition**
 - What is decolonisation in general
	 - Decolonisation is the practice of the identification and dismantlement of colonial systems and the structures the set within a specific area. The practice of decolonisation should work to redistribute any colonial power structures to allow for a more truthful representation of a specific study area as well as a more (idk the words for this rn but essentially allowing people to see themselves and the cultural heritage within a study area). Whilst increased inclusion and diversity should be a consequence of decolonisation it should not be its primary focus this is due to having EDI as its primary its primary focus would cause a rise in tokenism within any circle it is applied (read this sentence and make sure it makes sense and non exclusionary).
 - What does this mean for physics
	 - Whilst the laws, data, and mathematical systems used within physics are unobjective (idk if this is the right word) the methods, practices, and history of discoveries are not unobjective as the surcome to human error and "potential discrimination" (again idk if this is a good word choice). The decolonisation of physics looks to remove challenge previously thought truths of who discovered parts of physics and where this research took place IE the origin of optics, the established organisations that governs physics and how colonial view points affect these organisations, and overall to make physics a more truthful field where all physicists are able to thrive and see themselves/their cultures represented ( need to add some part about how other countries practice physics, also idk if the last point is all too relevant given the differences between diversity and decolonisation)
 - Should EDI be included in this
	 - If not how does EDI relate if at all
		 - Whilst increased inclusion and diversity should be an overarching consequence of the decolonisation of physics it should not be the primary goal but should set the foundation for this type of work. Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion's (EDI) primary goal is to increase the percentage amount minoritized groups to be equivalent to those of the majority groups (check if this is correct); Decolonisation at its core should increase the percentage of minoritized groups that have been detrimented due to colonial structures but this should not be the primary reason for decolonisation as using EDI as a primary reason can cause ethical fallacies (look at this) and tokenism within departments both contravene the ideas of decolonisation. Even though decolonisation's main reasoning should not be increased diversity, the practices of EDI may be built from the work of decolonisation as it easily extends from one to another and can be seen as a branch of this decolonisation work. Due to the intersectionality of the groups affected under current colonial ideas and information a large amount of groups will benefit from the work of decolonisation however some groups will benefit more due to being disproportionately detrimented by the current colonial mindset most notably people with cultural heritage from countries that were largely oppressed and occupied by the former British empire and other colonial powers.
- Combine all this into an actual concrete definition
- Come up with a soft version of this to explain the necessary things to academics
